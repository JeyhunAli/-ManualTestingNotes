https://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest/#_getting_started.  

To start with selenoid first we have to have compose.yml file  with all configuration of chrome firefox 
Then we need browser.json file with all configuration of browsers and their versions 
So 
Docker-compose file will read the browser.json file 
It will interact with it then it will setup the infrastructure 
And its possible to see actual running process with selenoid ui
Selenoid is not providing image installation and container creation that's the limitations but its actually intentionally by solenoid guys
