Create compose.yml,  browser.json file under one folder then access to that folder from 
Terminal 

Run.  docker-compose up -d 

Then try to run firefox or chrome versions by manual because 
Compose file it not providing you with browser versions why because there too Many browser versions 
Out there if you want based on your requirements you can download any browser you want by using 
docker pull selenoid/vnc:firefox_57.0    command in terminal 
Here vnc for visualization of browser 
So to find all the downloadable versions go -->  https://hub.docker.com/
Find selenoid chrome or firefox go to the tags section you will find all the versions 



To start with selenoid first we have to have compose.yml file  with all configuration of chrome firefox 
Then we need browser.json file with all configuration of browsers and their versions 
So 
Docker-compose file will read the browser.json file 
It will interact with it then it will setup the infrastructure 
And its possible to see actual running process with selenoid ui
Selenoid is not providing image installation and container creation that's the limitations but its actually intentionally by solenoid guys
