ManualTesting Notes  
BlackBoxTesting is basically testing the application functionality without looking into a code 
how it's written in application called as BlackBox Testing.
it's mainly done by Test Engineers.
Testers usually take the application and testing it basic and critical scenarios they are actual
 business flow of application here most important thing is Customer requirement 
based on the requirement we write test cases in black box testing passing a lot inputs then 
matching them with actual and expected result if theres failure raise a bug report it 
once its fixed retesting   
there 3 type of the blackBoxTesting 
1.Functional testing
2.Non-Functional Testing
3.Regression Testing 

DEFECT BUG ERROR FAILURE in Software Testing 
differences between them 
defect ----- when developers write a code for any application after that they are also testing it whether is working or not in their 
local setUp if actual behavior is different from expected it means thats a defect....

bug ----- when tester testing any application and finding that actual result different from expected result that leads to the bug 
and also they say if bug accepted by developers that calls a bug bug is also known as informal name of defect 

error ---- is while writing a code happening some mistakes and causing error even in compile time wont let u execute the code because 
some syntax issue or 
dead code or any kind of the coding is call as error

failure ----- when the application is ready coded tested and its in production environment and the customer or end user facing some issue 
that call as failure 

Difference between Retesting and Regression Testing
Retesting is testing previously failed test cases on the new build to verify that in the new build previously failed and raised as bug 
those bug fixed or not thats called Retesting 
Regression Testing is testing the unchanged part of application to test whether any kind of modification like adding new features removing 
something are not 
impacting unchanged part of the application that calls regression testing 
when we compare them retesting is taking more priority than regression testing 
when we do retesting we are planning them but regression testing we don't plan we just execute all the regression testing test cases 
retesting is basically done on the failed test cases regression testing is done on the passed test cases usually we don't automate retesting 
test cases but we automate regression testing test cases


Software Development Life cycle --> is during developing any kind software what all the stages is there its call as developmnet life cycle 
stages 
1. requirement collection 
2. Fesability requirement ----> hr team, business analyst, architect team, finance team they discuss about each and everything 
all the resources enough engineers 
3. design --- >> this stage contains 2 part low level design high level design 
low level design each and every feature of application 
high level design is overrole design general design of application 
4.code 
5. testing
6 releasing --- this stage is like installation and implementation 
7 maintenance ---> means after giving the software to the customer within 6 month or 1 year it depends any problem 
then solving 


What is Component Testing and it's types?
component like in login page name adress phone num email some like this fields call component 
testing each and every component of appliaction totally and regresly is calls component testing 
like doing positive testing negative testing 
in some company it calls as functional testing as well 
here also we do under testing over testing and optimise testing 

what is usability testing?--->> is how friendly the application testing the user friendliness of application is call test usability  for that testing how friendly is how accesible , how understanble designed . help center should be in application UA
proper messeges -- for example anything wrong passing data for  registration should throw some message for user to understand it 


Reliability testing and Recovery Testing
 this testing happening to check how relible the application how its done 
testing functionality of application again again it called Reliability testing for example testing login functionality multiple times to make sure how its relibly its basically testing application continiously and some period of time it calls Reliability testing
recovery testing is to check how application behaving after crushes or any disaster for example google Chrome 
when the laptop not responding or turning off 
when u turning it on again chrome says retore pages thats is the recovery testing 


Talking about test case design techniques and Types of the test case designing in Software testing life cycle			
1 error guessing techniques --> is like thinking in a very creative way to write negative test cases in order to break			
2.Equivalence class partitioning ---> means let's say you have text box field and it accepting numbers from 1-400			
in this case in order to check each and every number if it's accepting or not u just breaking it down into small class like  			
from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400   and from each and every couple you passing one number let's say  first - 77, second 177 			
third 266 , 4th 399  If it's accepting it means it passing and it's called as Equivalence class partitioning 			
3.Boundary Value Analysis means testing the value around the given value like   if requirement says you have to test numbers between			
20 and 25  then we write test 19 20 21 and 24 25 26 			
4.Decision Table Techniques  ---> here we check multiple condition, combinations and rule criteria  here condition take as 			
input and actions take as an output.  When I say condition and rules I take them as positive and negative TC bases based condition			
and I apply them in a appropiate way within rules 			
5. State Transition Techniques --> this means testing some component of application with state what I mean by that let's you are trying 			
to login the application after some time let's say after 6 attempts with wrong password u are bloked  the state of the steps . I mean all 			
all these attepts called as state transition technique. Basically u are testing application with 6 times with correct credentials and checking			
how application is behaving and after that 6 times until u block u are providing wrog credentials to check how state transition behaving
