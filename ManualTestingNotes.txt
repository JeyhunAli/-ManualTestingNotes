ManualTesting Notes  
BlackBoxTesting is basically testing the application functionality without looking into a code 
how it's written in application called as BlackBox Testing.
it's mainly done by Test Engineers.
Testers usually take the application and testing it basic and critical scenarios they are actual
 business flow of application here most important thing is Customer requirement 
based on the requirement we write test cases in black box testing passing a lot inputs then 
matching them with actual and expected result if theres failure raise a bug report it 
once its fixed retesting   
there 3 type of the blackBoxTesting 
1.Functional testing
2.Non-Functional Testing
3.Regression Testing 

DEFECT BUG ERROR FAILURE in Software Testing 
differences between them 
defect ----- when developers write a code for any application after that they are also testing it whether is working or not in their 
local setUp if actual behavior is different from expected it means thats a defect....

bug ----- when tester testing any application and finding that actual result different from expected result that leads to the bug 
and also they say if bug accepted by developers that calls a bug bug is also known as informal name of defect 

error ---- is while writing a code happening some mistakes and causing error even in compile time wont let u execute the code because 
some syntax issue or 
dead code or any kind of the coding is call as error

failure ----- when the application is ready coded tested and its in production environment and the customer or end user facing some issue 
that call as failure 

Difference between Retesting and Regression Testing
Retesting is testing previously failed test cases on the new build to verify that in the new build previously failed and raised as bug 
those bug fixed or not thats called Retesting 
Regression Testing is testing the unchanged part of application to test whether any kind of modification like adding new features removing 
something are not 
impacting unchanged part of the application that calls regression testing 
when we compare them retesting is taking more priority than regression testing 
when we do retesting we are planning them but regression testing we don't plan we just execute all the regression testing test cases 
retesting is basically done on the failed test cases regression testing is done on the passed test cases usually we don't automate retesting 
test cases but we automate regression testing test cases


Software Development Life cycle --> is during developing any kind software what all the stages is there its call as developmnet life cycle
