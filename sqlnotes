select * from emp;      sql query to get everything u've got here * is wild card to get all the data from emp table 

select distinct job from emp;      it will return only unique values from database

select * from emp
where job = 'MANAGER';      WHERE here further filter to get specific data and data written within single quotes 

select * from emp
where job = 'SALESMAN'
and sal = 1600
and comm = 300;      combination of where and here and equal to the where together all this will return one condition 


-- with and operator both side have to be true with or operator either one should be true 
-- and operator always execute first if in the statement they both are participated 

Use table-name-here  to start using that specific table in mysql  we use USE keyword

SELECT * 
FROM customers
 -- where customer_id = 7
order by first_name;       ----->> this statement will retrieve the data with sorting order  
Order by is used to sort the data on the basis of given values 
For example on the basis of alphabet or numeric from starting to ending 

With select statement we can choose any column name or * 
SELECT first_name, last_name  from customers
SELECT last_name, first_name from customers     when we choosing any column with select statement we change the order of 
coulmn as well for example last_name first point and the end  as per our requirements 

SELECT last_name, first_name , points, points + 10 as '10 percent more' from customers 
Here point as column name points plus 10  is arithmetic action adding 10 to existing numbers on points column 
As another keyword to specify any column name as you want 
And if new 
As arithmetic we can use  -, *, % and so on modular % is reminder of the value

SELECT last_name, first_name , points, points % 10 + (10 * 2) as '10 percent more' from customers
This one of the mathematical statements 

SELECT name, unit_price, unit_price * 1.1 as 'new price'
 FROM products
 order by name 
This one of the mathematical statements 

Customers from Virginia 
SELECT * from customers
where state = 'va'

Customers not from Virginia 
SELECT * from customers
where state <> 'va'   or instead of <> we can use !=

SELECT * from customers
where birth_date > '1986-03-28'
Customers birth date greater than 1986.  Date format is default in sql

SELECT * from customers
where birth_date > '1986-04-13'
and points > '947'
If we have and operator in our statements both the sides of and should be true 

SELECT * from customers
where birth_date > '1986-04-13'
or points > '947' 
With or operator at least one of the side has to be match 

In sql  * /. Have higher order than - +


SELECT * from customers
where birth_date > '1990-01-01'
or points > 100
and state = 'VA' 
If there and or operator together in one statement 
The preference will be first given (and) then (or) 
And combination will execute first
WE USE OR OPERATOR TO COMBINE multiple CONDITION 


SELECT * from customers
where not (birth_date > '1990-01-01'
or points > 100
and state = 'VA')
Not operator is used to negate the statements usually comes right after where clause 
And preferably its good idea to use parentheses after not operator for condition 
If there not operator > sign becomes <=
Or becomes and 


SELECT * from order_items
where order_id = 6 
and unit_price * quantity > 30
Get the items for order #6 where total price is greater than 30 
here unit_price is column we multiply it with quantity column and get result 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN operator IN SQL 
GET ALL THE CUSTOMERS FROM VIRGINIA 
select * from customers
WHERE state in ('VA', 'FL', 'TN')

Not in operator will give you output of the in operator 
Get GET ALL THE CUSTOMERS outside of VIRGINIA, fl, TN
select * from customers
WHERE state not in ('VA', 'FL', 'TN')

Return the product with quantity_in_stock equal to 49, 38, 70 
select * from products
where quantity_in_stock in (49, 38, 70)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHEN WE WANT TO GET RANGE OF THE VALUES WE USE BETWEEN OPERATOR FOR EXAMPLE 
GET THE CUSTOMERS WHO HAS MORE THAN 1000 AND LESS THAN 3000 POINTS 
We can write this statement like this     
                                           select * from customers
                                           where points >= 1000 and points <=3000
But this is lengthy code 
Here we can use between 
                                           select * from customers
                                           where points between 1000 and 3000
This is more compact and easy to read and understand 

RETURN CUSTOMERS BORN BETWEEN 1/1/1990 AMD 1/1/2000
Here birth format first year , month, day  and birth dates within single quotes 
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE birth_date between '1990-01-01' and '2000-01-01'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let me explain how to retrieve specific row is matching string pattern 
For that we have to use 'like' operator 
Get all the customers who last name starts with 'B'
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE last_name like 'B%'
Here % after B means give me all the last names starts with B 
After b all the characters acceptable 
The percentage signs can be anywhere of the characters 
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE last_name like '%y'

                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE last_name like '%A%'
Another concept lets say we have requirement to get the name ending with y 
But before there are have to be 5 characters in that case we '_' operator 
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE last_name like '_____y'
Here I wrote 5 time _ then y 
Depends on requirements we can have the count of the _ in our query 
Another example starts with B ends with Y then we use this query
4 time underscore _ 
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE last_name like 'B____y'
% represent any character 
_ represent single character
Get the customers whose address contains trail or avenue 
                                           select * from customers WHERE address 
                                           like '%trail%' or address like '%avenue%'
Get the customers whose phone number ends with 9 
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE phone like'%9'
And also we can use not operator with % to get what we want 
For example 
Get the customers whose phone number don't ends with 9 
                                           select * from customers
                                           WHERE phone not like'%9'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have another way to do that specially its extremely powerful with searching strings in sql 
REGEXP ---> ITS USED TO WITH COMPLEX PATTERNS  for example 
                                           Select * from customers 
                                           Where last_name REGEXP 'field'
With this expression we don't need percentage sign 
If We use (^ carrot) sign beginning of the pattern its indicate the starting point
If we use ( dollar $) sign at the end its indicate ending point
For example Select * from customers 
            Where last_name REGEXP '^field'  ---> must Strat With field

            Select * from customers 
            Where last_name REGEXP 'field$' --->> must end with field
With REGEXP ---> we can search multiple words in one line with  pipe separated way 
For example 
                                           select * from customers
                                           where last_name REGEXP 'brush|Nase|My|MAC' 
HERE we can have one two or more pipe this words represent part of the last name 
And it helps us to find people with this last names on database

If we put (carrot ^) sign in the begging it will return the last names starting with the words which we 
Provided 
For example 
                                           select * from customers
                                           where last_name REGEXP '^brush|Nase|My|MAC' 
If we put (dollar $) sign at the end it will return the last names ending with the words which we 
Provided 
For example 
                                           select * from customers
                                           where last_name regexp 'brush|Nase|My|MAC$' 
Lets say we have requirements to get customer whose last name contains letter e 
For example                                select * from customers
                                           where last_name regexp 'e' 

Lets say we have requirements to get customers whose last name contains before letter e 
Either g, I, m  either of these characters should come before e 
For example for that we do                 select * from customers
                                           where last_name regexp '[gim]e' 
We can do it in reverse order as well for example any letter followed
 By e 
                                           select * from customers
                                           where last_name regexp 'e[gim]' 

This concept calls using square brackets to get the requirements back

Another concept for example we have to get the range of characters before the letter e 
We can give the range like that give me beginning of the letters from a-h   before the e
For example                                select * from customers
                                           where last_name regexp '[a-h]e' 


Get the customers whose name 

First names are elka or amber
select * from customers
where first_name regexp 'elka|ambur' 

Last name end with ey or on
select * from customers
where last_name regexp 'ey$|on$'

select * from customers
where last_name regexp '^my|se'

Last name contains b followed by r or u 
1.
select * from customers
where last_name regexp 'b[ru]' 

2.
select * from customers
where last_name regexp 'bu|br' 

--------------------------------------------

Now 
How to get the values with missing values 
As we now that null value is consider absence of any attribute in database 
To get that missing value we use is null clause for example 

select * from customers
where phone is null       here the customer hasn't a phone number 

Another opposite site using is null 
Using is not null for example 

select * from customers
where phone is not null

Exercise  get the orders are not shipped yet 

--------------------------------------------
Order by clause 
Is used to sort the data on the basis of column name 
By default any query we write its coming on by order 
But with order by clause we explicitly define that we want this query executed by 
Sorted of specific column name for example 

Select * from customers 
Order by first_name 
Here first name column will be executed by sorted order alphabetically 

We can also sort the data by multiple column for example 
select * from customers
order by first_name, last_name, state

Desc this clause will execute state by descending order for example 
select * from customers
order by first_name desc

In mySQL we can sort the date on the select clause by any column name but in another database management system its not allowed 
For example  in this statement I will show u we can 
Sort first name , last name by birth date 
Here is 
                                           select first_name, last_name
                                           from customers 
                                           order by birth_date

We can also sort the data by an aliens 
select first_name, last_name, 10 as points
from customers 
order by points, birth_date 
Here 10 as points not column its just number added 

-------------------------------------------------
select *, quantity * unit_price as total_price
from order_items
where order_id =2
order by quantity * unit_price desc

To avoid duplicates we can use this way 

select *, quantity * unit_price as total_price
from order_items
where order_id =2
order by total_price desc
--------------------------------------------------

Now lets talk about limit 
How to limit the number of records which is returned from our query
Basically lets say we have 10 0r 100 records but we want to get only 3,4 records 

select * from customers 
limit 4                   --->> it will return only 4 records  from 1 to 4 

But lets say you want get records from starting from 7 to 9  or 
From 5 to 8  then we should follow this concept 
From   7, 2          
this means give me the  number 8,9

from 5, 3 
This means give me the  number 6,7,8

Exercise: get the top tree loyal customers    
select * from customers 
order by points desc
limit 3

Limit clause should always come et the end 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Joins concept in MySql

A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

1.inner Join
Inner Join clause in SQL is used to combine rows that have matching values in two or more tables. 
It means both table has to have common, same column based on that we are using inner join in sql

select order_id, c.customer_id as mainID, first_name, last_name, order_date, shipped_date
from customers as c, orders as o
where c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

Here using inner joins concept without joins keyword and we have alias
As well and if you want to print as column matched inner join column. in select clause u have to mention about by 
Writing from what column id u want to print 


select order_id, orders.customer_id, first_name, last_name, birth_date
from orders 
inner join customers 
		on orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
Here Im using with inner joins keyword 

Exercise:
Write a query to join order_items table with products table
For each order return both order id as well as its name followed by quantity and unit_price
From the order_items table and by the way try to use alias to simplify the code

Solution:
SELECT order_id, OT.product_id, quantity, P.unit_price
from order_items as OT
inner join products P on OT.product_id = P.product_id

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Joining across databases 

SO TO join FROM different database pretty simple 
Lets say we have to database in our platform one of them name 
sql_store, another one is sql_inventory 
Both are the database they have their own tables and everything 
Once we want to join them together we use join keyword 
And as well as matching point and we have to use prefix on table NAME which is coming from different database 
What u need to remember u have to only prefix the table that are not part of the database
For example 

select * 
from order_items O
join sql_inventory.products P 
on O.product_id = P.product_id 

Here sql_inventory.products P as prefix followed by alias
If your current database is not in use u have to prefix it as well 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In sql <table> can join with itself too here basically we joining two columns instead of tables
And using alias for simplifying and differentiation 
Its pretty much same as table joining concept just here joining columns and using aliases 
FOR EXAMPLE:
SELECT *
from employees e
join employees m
on e.reports_to = m.employee_id;

Here e, m just alias, reports_to one column, employee_id is another column 
Here. We are just joining two columns 
We can use inner join outer join concept 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Lets see how to join more than two tables
For that two times we use join keyword 
1st we join tables which they have matching column 
2nd we join third table to one of the previous table which has matching column and it better to use aliases to simplify 
The query and more understanding point of view 
Example 
select o.order_id, o.order_date, c.first_name, c.last_name, os.name AS status
from orders o
join customers c
on o.customer_id=c.customer_id
join order_statuses os
on o.status = os.order_status_id 

The aliases on select clause always do at the end first select * then get familiar with the table then 
Its good to have aliases and choosing columns based on table 

Exercise 
Write a querry 
join the payments table with payment_method table as well as client table 
Produce a report that it shows payment with more detail such as name of client and payment method name,
Amount and address 

Solution:
use sql_invoicing;
select p.date, 
       p.invoice_id, 
       p.amount, 
       c.name AS 'customer Name', 
       c.address, 
       c.state, 
       pm.payment_method_id,
       pm.name
from payments p
join clients c
on p.client_id = c.client_id
join payment_methods pm
 on p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compound join condition 
So far we use single column which is uniquely identified in the table 
What does it means ? 
It means we have table column in our data base and each column has data which is not repetitive 
Its unique 

But in this example I will show u lets say we have columns which is holding duplicate or more than two values 
And to get the data from those column we have to use two three column combination together with join clause 
To achieve compound join concept
Usually this kind column we describe
That they have primary key in more than one column and that calls composite primary key 
"Composite primary key is contains more than one column" 
Basically in these type of data the combination of two columns are representing unique items
For example 
select * 
from order_items o
join order_item_notes oi
on o.order_id = oi.order_Id
and oi.product_id=oi.product_id
 
Here joining two table finding first matching and here order_id 
And second matching column which
 Is product id 
This calls <<<<<Compound join condition >>>>>>


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Implicit JOIN syntax 
THIS MEANS joining tables without join keyword 
For example 
SELECT *
FROM order_item_notes OI, order_items O
WHERE OI.order_Id=O.order_id
This means implicit syntax concept its better to be aware of this concept 
But its always good practice to use join keyword to avoid any syntax error 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

OUTER JOIN CONCEPT
In sql two type of the join inner join and outer join if we don't write anything in front of 
Join keyword it consider as inner join 
If we use inner join concept we get as result only matching points from two tables
But with outer join we get matching point and as well as on the basis of right to left table data as well 
Outer join also divided into two part 
There are two types of the outer joins 
Left joins and right joins
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2).
When we using left join concept 
We can swap the table 
What table we write first that table will be our left table 

For example 
select c.customer_id, c.first_name, o.order_id
from customers c
left join orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
order by c.customer_id

Exercise 
-- write a program to join order_items table with products table 
-- and simplify on select clause to get product id name and item quantity
-- to see which items ordered how many times 
-- and sort on the basis of product id

Solution 
select p.product_id, p.name, oi.quantity
from order_items oi
right join products p
on oi.product_id = p.product_id
order by p.product_id


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Outer joins with multiple tables 

In this concept we will see how to use together outer join (left, right join)
Together with inner join inside one query to get exact output we want 
But as expert says avoid to use left right inner join all together its more complex to read better use left join
With inner join 
Here is one example 
select c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_id, sh.name AS Shipper
from customers c
left outer join orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
left join shippers sh 
on o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
order by o.order_id

Exercise:
Write a query to get this result 
Order date,  order id, first name, last name, shipper and status
Hint here you will join 4 table together as per their matching column 

Solution :
select 
o.order_id, 
order_date, 
c.first_name, 
c.last_name, 
sh.name AS shipper,
os.name AS status 
from customers c
join orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
left join shippers sh
on o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
left join order_statuses os
on o.status = os.order_status_id
order by o.order_id


--------------------------------------------------------------------

SELF OUTER JOIN 
Looks like self join just here we are using outer join concept either left or right join 

Example
SELECT 
e.employee_id, 
e.first_name,
m.first_name AS Manager
from employees e
join employees m
on e.reports_to = m.employee_id;

Great example for that lets say I'm using self inner join concept 
To get all the employees who reporting to manager 
Im getting all the employees but one record is missing its manager 
But manager is not reporting to itself that's why is missing 
Here if I use left join concept I will get all the records as well as manager as well 
But in manager records it will show null 
Where the reporting is displayed because manager is not reporting to himself 


--------------------------------------------------------------------

USING CLAUSE 
this feature is so helpful let me tell u how to use it 
For example in join clause we have to match one table to another table 
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id like this-->> and it lengthy when we have complex query 
And we can use "using" clause. using clause replacing  <<<<on c.customer_id = o.customer_id>>>> this line 
But we have to make sure that both table same name other wise it won't work 

SELECT * 
from customers c
join orders o
-- on c.customer_id = o.customer_id       ---->>> it means customer_id is existing in orders table as well as customers table 
using (customer_id)
Left join shippers 
using(shipper_id)       ---->>> it means shipper_id is also existing in orders table 

If we have specific requirements to have some column name on select clause in that case we have this kind query

SELECT o.order_id, c.first_name, sh.name
from customers c
join orders o
-- on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
using (customer_id)
left join shippers sh
using(shipper_id)

<<<<<<<PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO HERE >>>>>>>>>>

select *
from order_items oi
join order_item_notes oin
-- on oi.order_id = oin.order_Id
-- and oi.product_id = oin.product_id
using (order_id, product_id)

HERE in this query we have two tables which both of them have some columns and combination of two columns uniquely identifying one id 
On one table  
And combination of two columns uniquely identifying one id on another table { --  means commented out In MySql )

Exercise:
Write a query to get payments from payments table 
That will show on what day why get paid how much and using the method of payment method 
On select clause I want to see date, client, amount, name 

Solution:
select p.date, c.name AS client, p.amount, pm.name
from payments p
 left join clients  c
using (client_id)
 left join payment_methods pm
on p.payment_id = pm.payment_method_id

HERE IN THIS QUERY I USE "USING" KEY WORD AND AND WITHOUT THAT 
BECAUSE IN ONE condition ONE OF THE COLUMN NAME IS DIFFERENT 
IN ORDER TO USE "USING" KEYWORD BOTH COLUMN FROM DIFFERENT TABLE HAVE TO BE exactly SAME NAME 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NATURAL JOINS 

THIS join as name suggests natural basically we are relying on database engine 
To join our two table on the basis of matching column 
Here natural join will do it by itself finding matching columns and joining them together 
But most of the time companies not recommend using natural
Join it can be serious problems that's why it better to use regular joins concept 
Let me show u how to write query with natural join 
For example 
select c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_id
from customers c
Natural join orders o

Because of natural join can produce unexpected results that's why its discouraged to use that 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CROSS JOINS
THIS JOIN is used to combine everything from table a 
With table b 
That's why there's no on condition after join keyword because its combining everything all the data 
For example:

select * 
from customers
cross join orders
Here we can provide some select clause values any columns as well 

Real time example for cross joins 
Lets say u have a table with all size small big large 
And u have another table with all the colors red blue white orange 
And u want to combine all of them together in that case its very useful 

Exercise:
Do cross join between shippers and products using implicit syntax and explicit syntax 
implicit syntax  means without cross join keyword and explicit syntax with cross join 

Solution:
select * 
from shippers sh
cross join products p
order by sh.name;

select * 
from shippers sh , products p
order by p.name

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNIONS 
So far we learned how to combine multiple columns from different table using joins
But we can also combine multiple Raws from different table by using UNIONS statement

For example:
select 
      order_id, 
      order_date,
      'Active' AS status    ------>>>> this line is just string for labeling condition is not existing in current database table I added explicitly 
from orders 
where order_date >= '2019-01-01'

-- using UNION operator we can combine these two statement and execute it as one query
Union

select 
      order_id, 
      order_date,
      'Archived' AS status         ------>>>> this line is just string for labeling condition is not existing in current database table I added explicitly 
from orders 
where order_date < '2019-01-01'

This means using union operator we can combine multiple queries 
In this example these two queries against same table 
But we can also have queries against different table and we can combine result into one result set 
One thing just remember number of columns that each query returns should be Equal otherwise you are going to get an error

For example: 
select first_name, last_name
from customers
union 
select name 
from shippers

Here one select clause two condition
Another select clause has one condition they both have two Equal to each other 
And this query with union keyword while executing it will pick
First statements name on the on the console as column name 

Exercise:
Write a query to produce this result 
customer_id, first_name, point, type 
We don't have type columns in our database so we calculated the values of this column based on point of each customer 
If they have less than 2000 points their type bronze 
If they have between 2000 and 3000 point their type silver 
And if they have more than 3000 they are gold customers 
And sort the result by first_name 

Solution:
select customer_id, first_name, points, 'bronze' AS type
from customers
where points <=2000 
union
select customer_id, first_name, points, 'silver' AS type
from customers
where points between 2000 and 3000
union
select customer_id, first_name, points, 'gold' AS type
from customers
where points >3000 
order by first_name

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attributes of the columns 

VARCHAR() in short variable characters most important concept here lets say we define our characters with varchar(50) 
We can add the words up to 50 characters no more than that if we add less than that for example 5 length character rest of the 45 empty space will 
Not waste but in char() is not like that 
Its best practice to use varchar
DATE()
CHAR() its also accepting characters but lets say u define your char(50) and you have 5 characters length value in that case mysql will add 45 more empty spaces to fill up the space 
INT() MOSTLY used for id of the each row of the columns pure integer numbers it holds numbers 1,2,3,4,5, and so on


Pk stands for primary key its uniquely identifying the values in the columns 
NN stands for nor null it determines that if this column can accept null values or not 
AI stands for auto increments mostly used with primary key when we have auto increment on it adds id incrementally 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inserting A single ROW 

1st way here we are not mentioning about column name just inserting data 
NN not null

Our columns : 
Primary key and
Ai auto increment     NN           NN                            NN      NN     NN     NN 
customer_id,         first_name, last_name, birth_date, phone, address, city, state, points

Here birth_date and phone can be null 


insert into customers 
values(
        default,               --->>>> means it takes id value from sql provided. Because we define it as AI
       'Jeyhun',
       'Aliyev',
       '1988-02-01',
       '555987777',
       'ShoreParkway',
       'Brooklyn',
       'NY',
        599
          
)

2nd way 
Explicitly defining table names on insert statement 

insert into customers (first_name, 
                       last_name, 
                       birth_date, 
                       address, 
                       city, 
                       state
                       )
values(
       'Emiliya',
       'Aliyeva',
       '2019-12-25',
       'ShoreParkway',
       'Brooklyn',
       'NY'
		
          
)
	

insert into customers 
values(
        default,               --->>>> means it takes id value from sql provided. Because we define it as AI
       'Jeyhun',
       'Aliyev',
        Null                   --->>>> can be null 
       '555987777',
       'ShoreParkway',
       'Brooklyn',
       'NY',
        Default                --->>>> because point accepting integer data and default value as zero
          
)			



Once you executing this this single row inserting statement you will see id is generating automatically 
So it takes last value and increment it by one 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inserting A multiple ROW 

In this example we have one table shippers and two columns 


Primary 
key andAi     NN 
shipper_id,  name   

But while inserting multiple rows we not defining id because id declared as AI auto increment it generates automatically 

insert into shippers(name)
	values
          ('Jeyhun'),
          ('Adam'),
          ('Nastya'),
          ('Emiliya')

Another example:  inserting four values 

insert into products(name, quantity_in_stock, unit_price)
       values ('fridge', 10, 4.7),
	      ('basket', 20, 4.5),
              ('umbrella', 20, 5.5),
	      ('Table', 19, 9.5)
