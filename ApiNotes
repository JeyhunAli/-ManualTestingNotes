API -application programming interface 
http - hypertext transfer protocol and s means secure 
So more secure connection most api should be using s 

Query parameters - are additional data we can submit with our request 
For some api they are mandatory but some is optional 
Query param must be same as written in documents 

Path variables - when we want to get additional more information with specific request then we use it 
As name applies variables it changes all the time and path variables or path parameters most of the time applies at the end of the request url
Path var is for more specific info 
When u have path var and its value in request bar 
In the url portion postman will take value and on the background variable will run 

Post request.  With the post request we to supply body 
With the post http request basically we are sending the data 
Note: when we are in same domain and want to send same http request in different request tab but with different query or Path param simple just to avoid manual creation we can click 3 dots and duplicate the request and then change the name accordingly 
401 "error": "Missing Authorization header." This mostly comes when we aren't providing header in post request
