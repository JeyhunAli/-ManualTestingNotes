To restart your Jenkins you can put on the url after localhost:8080/restart
Or from terminal control+c 

U can run your test cases from any branch in Jenkins 
 




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once u installed u will get initiall setup is required and will provide 
One token for u 
Copy that token 
Provide with jdk 8 and java_home path 
Html publisher plugin
Allure
Maven integration plugin

Csp plugin for google chrome to see extent report

copy that pswd
got to to url
write localhost:8080
then enter the paswd
then then clcik on install suggestion plugins then create username pwd then start to use jenkins



nother concept along with jenkins is ngrok.com
this something another amazing feature which is allow you as soon as you check in in the git repo jenkkins automatically built the triggers and execute
yoour test cases no need to go again to jenkins and execute it


for that first need to sign up on ngrok.com

then its gonna provide with one token
and port
add then via terminal or in cmd
then go to your github project directory add link then good to go

its mandatory to add all the important plugins in order to execute all the test cases throughout jenkins
if you want to create pipeline the most famous and with full feature one is blue ocean pipeline concept
  
when you are executing all your test cases make sure the reporting tool configuration is done correctly 
either its extent report or allure report 

java -jar jenkins.war  after downloading jenkins go to directory in the terminal then run this command

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

once UI of jenkins available then go to the manage jenkins --> Global tool configurations 
uncheck automatic jdk download then provide with java patah first give it name for instance jdk 
then go to the termianal echo $HAVA_HOME this cmd will print path of the java jdk 
for the windows just go to the environemnt then copy the javahome 
then copy the path and paste it jenkins where java_home 
then scroll down give the name of the maven leave it automatic download then apply ans save 
first and basic configuration 
if your java home not set up in mac  just go vim or vi ~/.bash_profile if it there its ok if not then providde it 

then go to the manage plugins add plugins search for testng add without restart
then manage plugins -> available -> search for maven add maven integration 
then manage plugins -> available -> search for allure add allure click on install without restart
then manage plugins -> available -> search for html add html publisher instal without retart
then manage plugins -> manage plugins -> Global Tool Configuration then give the name to allure then add version of allure 
then apply and save 


after all this you copy your github link where your project is 
then add it into jenkins add some report initally extent report html report 
but when u add extent report after executing it will generate the report but it will be kind a broken 
just need to go to the google chrome download one csp plugin for chrome activate oit refresh the page then it will be proper 
report

if the company dont allow that u can go manage jenkins -> scrtpt console add this line code 
System.setProperty("Hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "") then run you will result written below 
this not allowed in some company u can ask devops team
