BDD -- > behavior driven development notes
 In this approach everybody in the same page first of all 
Cucumber is just a framework or its a tool to apply when we have BDD 

TDD   ----   BDD  -------  ATDD

TDD   is always writing test cases first most of the time they are fail then making them work perfectly fine then refactoring it making it very suitable and trustworthy and solid code then production this cycle is all around in the add approach u have to keep enhancing and keep repeating this cycle entirely project to make it Solid 
ITS MORE FOCUSED ON unit level test cases 

BDD   is extension of the TDD HERE another concept is feature file scenarios and written test steps in gherkin language given when then 
Asking right questions why when how is the key concept to be more collaborative in these both approach 
The cycle same 
writing test cases first most of the time they are fail then making them work perfectly fine then refactoring it making it very suitable and trustworthy and solid code then production this cycle is all around in the add approach u have to keep enhancing and keep repeating this cycle entirely project to make it Solid 

ATDD    acceptance test driven development 
This is high level approach on top of the BDD  main guys PO business analyst 
Inside THE ATDD  business or PO deciding what approach to use either is BDD or TDD

2) feature file creation 
Gherkin language DSL domain specific language 
How to achieve test driven developments in add 
So we write feature file scenario executing that writing our code its failing then we are improving code making it trustworthy executing again 


3) mapping between step definition and feature file the moment you some changes in your feature file immediately it will be reflected to the step definition as well as feature file 
According to the maven build structure feature file file should be part of your src/test/resources
Source folder 

https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-eclipse-update-site-snapshot
This url will help you to make sure u have updated version of cucumber plugin scroll down find work with --->> url 
Copy. That url and go to the eclipse then check it
After implementing snippets code to the step def go back to the feature file make sure green color each and every steps are marked 
In feature file press command or ctrl in windows and hower on steps you will see all the steps are lined up u can click and it jump on that method in step definition class 

4)cucumber supports 2 kind expression 
Cucumber expression
Regular expression
Two types of Reg Expressions in Cucumber:

1. Regular Expression: [0-9]+, (\\d+)
2. Cucumber Expression (introduced in 2017) 

Rules:
1. Step def file will be generating cucumber expression only by default
2. But you can use regular expression also in step def file 
3. You can mix both regular and cucumber expression in step definition file
4. But you can not mix both expressions in the same step definition method


5)Tagging concept in Cucumber 
Tag can be applied feature and scenario level not on given when then 
If feature has tag it will apply to all the scenarios 
If scenario has a tag its separate from other scenarios 
What tags mentioned in the runner class that scenario will be execute 
We can pass two tags in the same scenario
For example 

@smoke @regression   
In the runner class we have to write 
tags = "@smoke and regression". Then it will pick that scenario which is written with these tags
But lets say if we don't have this combination In the feature file and they are separately written from each other's  for example 
@smoke 
Scenario:

@regression
Scenario:

In this case if we write in runner class 
Tags = "@smoke and regression " it will pick zero scenarios and nothing will execute 
 
  
We can give two tags for example smoke and sanity to single scenario 
In the runner class any 2tags with and separator if we apply and if there are no any scenario like that zero feature file will execute 
Lets say u want to execute all the scenarios except one 
U don't need to mention all of them in the runner class 
Just write 
tags = "not @your tags name"
Along with these u can write @All  on top of the Feature. For example 
"@All"
Feature:

 in the runner class it will execute all the test cases 
Here all the scenarios are inheriting @All. 
From command line u can also run your test cases ---->>> mvn test 
It will execute as you apply in the runner class 
But lets say u have given @All tags or any other for example @smoke or @sanity @regression in the runner class 
Whenever u run your test cases from cmd you can mention here also like
 
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke"  -->> this cmd belongs to cucumber version 6
 this cmd will pick and execute only smoke test case it doesn't matter if you write sanity or @All in your runner class 
This class overriding tags in terminal

In maven it will show u that u mentioned @All along with @smoke and whatever tags u run 
mvn test -Dcucumber.options.tags="All" this cmd belongs to cucumber version 4 

@smoke @QA-ready @user-story-9090 @Epic-10 we can provide in our feature file this format as well here we are given our user story number epic number along with 
@smoke test tags 
This tags is helping for documentation point of view and later on we can relate it with any test management tool like jira and quality center QC 



6)Background keyword in cucumber 
This keyword is used to define pre condition for all the scenarios 
Instead of repeating the same Given steps in all of the scenarios in a Feature file 
We can move such Given steps to the background, by grouping them under a Background keyword.
It can contain one or more Given steps, which are run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks.



7)Hooks In Add Cucumber 
It will help to do precondition and how to define post steps 
Hooks are never part of the feature file it part of the step def configuration file 
SetUp and TearDown just like in testNG 

We can have multiple @before hook  before each method 

@Before  ---->>>> will be execute before each scenario 
method1(order = 1) 
@Before 
Method2 (order = 2) --- these are pre condition 


@After  ------->>> will be execute after each scenario 
Same thing we can do for after method too
For example close browser, disconnect database 

@BeforeStep ------->>>> before each step of the scenarios 
@AfterStep  ------->>>> after each step of the scenarios
