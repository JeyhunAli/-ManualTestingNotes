BDD -- > behavior driven development notes
 In this approach everybody in the same page first of all 
Cucumber is just a framework or its a tool to apply when we have BDD 

TDD   ----   BDD  -------  ATDD

TDD   is always writing test cases first most of the time they are fail then making them work perfectly fine then refactoring it making it very suitable and trustworthy and solid code then production this cycle is all around in the add approach u have to keep enhancing and keep repeating this cycle entirely project to make it Solid 
ITS MORE FOCUSED ON unit level test cases 

BDD   is extension of the TDD HERE another concept is feature file scenarios and written test steps in gherkin language given when then 
Asking right questions why when how is the key concept to be more collaborative in these both approach 
The cycle same 
writing test cases first most of the time they are fail then making them work perfectly fine then refactoring it making it very suitable and trustworthy and solid code then production this cycle is all around in the add approach u have to keep enhancing and keep repeating this cycle entirely project to make it Solid 

ATDD    acceptance test driven development
