1. Download git SCM   https://git-scm.com/downloads
First time always cloning process 
Get the url then create folder directory inn your local machine 
Then go to that directory in terminal type 
Git clone url 
Then import to your eclipse or intelije 

 Git is version control system 
Git and GitHub is not same 
Git------>>> is control system used to track changes in computer files it’s a tool to manage your code 
  GitHub---->>>> is hosting service for git repositories  basically git is tool GitHub is service to use the git

Git --  first create a project on GitHub  give it a name make it public then 

 Come to you local project copy your project path 
Commands 
cd  your path  enter 
Ls -alt    means what are different files are available 
git  init 
git status
ls -alt 

copy this from GitHub 
git remote add origin https://github.com/JeyhunAli/Vison-Live-Hubspot-Project.git
git status 
git add .       
git status      -you will see all the files become green color 
git commit -m  “this is my project code ready to push”
git push origin master 
 

let’s say you have code already exist in GitHub but in your local machine u made some changes 
and you want to push it again to the GitHub 
for that copy path of the project 

cd path enter 
git status enter 
then you will see some modified files some new class or whatever 
then need to add them to the index stage area 

for that copy that file which is start with src 
usually it comes in red color 

git add   paste here copied file enter 

if you have multiple of them do multiple time 
git add paste copied file 

git status enters
git commit -m “your message” enter
git push origin master or whatever you have branch there 

now I’m going to talk about cloning process 

first of all, creating one folder in laptop then copy folder path go to the terminal 
cd paste-path enters 
ls -alt 
git clone URL enter
then go to the eclipse right click on where all the projects then import either from existing 
maven project or from git 
cloning process we do when team lead or senior QA guy created GitHub repo then we as a testers 
cloning then starting to work on that 



now branching 

first of all, in GitHub where project name creates new branch give it a name 
then come to the eclipse make some changes in your existing file 
then copy path of the project go to the terminal 
cd path enters 
git fetch && git checkout name of your new branch enter -- pointing to the new branch

git branch enters  shows how many branches are available 
new name become green color 
git status enters 
you will see some modified files in red color then 
git add . enter 
git commit -m “your message” enter
git push origin here your new branch name instead of master enter 
git push -u origin master here -u means add untracked file also which is not commited 

PR process is done completely in GitHub website 


After pull request if you want to switch the branch from branch to the master command for that 

git fetch && git checkout master   enter 

then 
git pull origin master enter 


when u clone the project from github after your teamlead added then u clone it 
when it comes to push the code to remote 
don’t push directly first 
use git status, git add . git commit,  after git commit  if you type git branch u will see master branch is created now time to switch the branch for that git branch branchName
then check again if it's created git branch once u see it's created then use git checkout branchName 
now it will point to the new branch and now u can push the code to the new branch because 
master branch is stable once u confirmed then u can push the master
once everything is done then commit the code then 
git push origin branchname





Creating folder from terminal first going that directory cd ..
Jeys-MBP:/ jey$ mkdir /Users/jey/Documents/gittxt
Then git init 

Then copy from github link.  Example 
git remote add origin https://github.com/JeyhunAli/gittxt.git

then git clone url 
then creating file from terminal touch file1.txt

then if you want to write something into this file 
vim file1.txt 
then press I insert some value or text

then press esc and   :wq  or :wq!  to get out 

then git status 

then git add . 
then git commit -m “your message”

then git branch you will see master branch in green color 

then git branch branch name – creating new branch 
then git branch you will see two branch one master another one given 

then switch the branch --- git checkout branchname

then git branch it will point to created one 
then vim file2.txt   press I enter your text then esc then :wq 
do some changes 
ls enter 

then git add . 
then git status
then git commit -m “your message ”
then git push origin test1

in cmd line if you want to print what is written inside the file 
then cat file1.txt enter


In git  git push -u origin test2 
-u It's means  pls add untracked file also which is not commited 


And about how to to pr process for that pull request for 
First click pull reguest add your comments assign it to specific person 
Then click create pull request once your reguest get approved then merge it 




Now some new topics in git about centralized repository and distributed repository 

Centralized version control system  CVCS
SVN VSS PERFORCE CVS

DVCS distributed version control system 
GIT BITBUCKET BAZAAR

Git fetch and pull 
This concept we use let's say our team lead or senior guy pushed already new code to the master branch after couple day 
Another guy have to get it In his working set 
No need to to everytime git clone after new code available on master branch here we use fetch or pull 

Fetch and pull almost same but there is configuration is different it might be confusing 
So pull directly pulling to working copy are and same time it goes to the local repo 

But with the fetch first it goes to local repo then you have to merge it from local repo to working copy area 
Differences between fetch and pull 
With the fetch we have to use merge cmd in order to have it in local set
But pull bring it directly working set

Git pull origin master  you can pull updated verion of the project
Git remote -v  this cmd will show you exact link if something changed in git repo

Once u made some changes in github 
While pushing new something it wont push 

First u have to add . then commit 

Then  u have to use git pull origin master
 It will open comment section in terminal provide with explanation then exit 
Press esc + : + wq! 
It will escape 
And then push your code 







differences between fetch and pull is fetch is start with fetch to local repo then merge to working copy 
but pull directly pull it to the working copy but same time it fetch to the local repo as well

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When you clone a repository, it is added as a remote of yours, under the name origin. What you need to do now (as you're not using the old source anymore) is change origin's URL:

$ git remote set-url origin http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO
If the original repository would update often and you want to get those updates from time to time, then instead of editing origin it would be best to add a new remote:

$ git remote add personal http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO
Or maybe even call the old one upstream:

$ git remote rename origin upstream
$ git remote add origin http://github.com/YOU/YOUR_REPO
Then, whenever you want to get changes from upstream, you can do:

$ git fetch upstream

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Git stash concept 

To understand the process first create a file on the remote Side imagine somebody push new code to master which is u also working on that code exactly same 
Then 
Pull new code from master branch
Use 
git pull origin master 
You are going to get this message -->  error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
	                               git_stash.txt
                                       Please move or remove them before you merge.
                                       Aborting
 Basically it says either you commit the code or add it to the stash memory 
What you going to do first add it 

git add git_stash.txt 

Then 

git stash
U will get this message --> Saved working directory and index state WIP on practicaljavacode: b420f8e new class question that asked in interview


Then pull it once again use 

Git pull origin master


Then y will get some error message to solve it use this 
1.  press "i" (i for insert)
2.  write your merge message
3.  press "esc" (escape)
4.  write ":wq" (write & quit)
5.  then press enter


And after that if u check the code u write is gone its stored in stash memory 
Instead you will see the code from remote side this is the code from someone's merge to master 
But to get your actual code back 
To get it back u have to use command --> 

Git stash pop 
After this u will get this message -->  CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in src/javaCodingChallenge/m1.java
Here this critical scenario starting actual conflict discussion with team members 
Then deciding to keep which code and delete which code in local side 
Example 

package javaCodingChallenge;

public class m1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
		System.out.println("this method remote ");
=======
		System.out.println("this method local ");
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

	}

}

Here you can clearly see remote method and local method with stashed changes after discussing you deleting one of this then continue your work 

Then check the status of the code
Git status

Git add

Git commit

Git push origin master


When u doing all this make sure your branch is pointing to what branch 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revert concept in GitHub   ----->>>>> return to (a previous state, practice, topic, etc.).
Lets say you pushed wrong code and you want to revert it back 

1.  Check the log  -->    git log --oneline
Basically how it works this log will show you all the logs and the command now you gonna add it will change to to previous one 
For example 

bfb1719 (HEAD -> master, origin/master) new fun
1382b75 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/JeyhunAli/all_about_java hey
66db7c4 new lines added
9f98340 Merge pull request #5 from JeyhunAli/practicaljavacode
b420f8e (origin/practicaljavacode) new class question that asked in interview
4f5ac13 new methods
566f3f4 new classes
9d9cc0d new methods
eed12fb new classes
9f353cb new classes and notes
5e2ffa1 new classes added
0b6917a new classes added
36f6f4d new code new class about color
8ed66b0 modified classes available
ce3ba36 new file
71559b9 new classes added
c3342fc new classes added
514fbf8 new code
adc3b8a some new code added with notes
4b8a345 some code added
83ec209 java code added with notes
9e4c5bc new code added
129dd3b java code added


Here first line is my last commit and it has id number at the beginning 
Git reset --hard 66db7c4

Then u will get this message 
HEAD is now at 66db7c4 new lines added

Now do this git command 
Git push -f origin master 
You will see the result your wrong push was deleted 
Even deleted from local as well
