 Git is version control system 
Git and GitHub is not same 
Git------>>> is control system used to track changes in computer files it’s a tool to manage your code 
  GitHub---->>>> is hosting service for git repositories  basically git is tool GitHub is service to use the git

Git --  first create a project on GitHub  give it a name make it public then 

 Come to you local project copy your project path 
Commands 
cd  your path  enter 
Ls -alt    means what are different files are available 
git  init 
git status
ls -alt 

copy this from GitHub 
git remote add origin https://github.com/JeyhunAli/Vison-Live-Hubspot-Project.git
git status 
git add .       
git status      -you will see all the files become green color 
git commit -m  “this is my project code ready to push”
git push origin master 
 

let’s say you have code already exist in GitHub but in your local machine u made some changes 
and you want to push it again to the GitHub 
for that copy path of the project 

cd path enter 
git status enter 
then you will see some modified files some new class or whatever 
then need to add them to the index stage area 

for that copy that file which is start with src 
usually it comes in red color 

git add   paste here copied file enter 

if you have multiple of them do multiple time 
git add paste copied file 

git status enters
git commit -m “your message” enter
git push origin master or whatever you have branch there 

now I’m going to talk about cloning process 

first of all, creating one folder in laptop then copy folder path go to the terminal 
cd paste-path enters 
ls -alt 
git clone URL enter
then go to the eclipse right click on where all the projects then import either from existing 
maven project or from git 
cloning process we do when team lead or senior QA guy created GitHub repo then we as a testers 
cloning then starting to work on that 



now branching 

first of all, in GitHub where project name creates new branch give it a name 
then come to the eclipse make some changes in your existing file 
then copy path of the project go to the terminal 
cd path enters 
git fetch && git checkout name of your new branch enter -- pointing to the new branch

git branch enters  shows how many branches are available 
new name become green color 
git status enters 
you will see some modified files in red color then 
git add . enter 
git commit -m “your message” enter
git push origin here your new branch name instead of master enter 
git push -u origin master here -u means add untracked file also which is not commited 

PR process is done completely in GitHub website 


After pull request if you want to switch the branch from branch to the master command for that 

git fetch && git checkout master   enter 

then 
git pull origin master enter 


when u clone the project from github after your teamlead added then u clone it 
when it comes to push the code to remote 
don’t push directly first 
use git status, git add . git commit,  after git commit  if you type git branch u will see master branch is created now time to switch the branch for that git branch branchName
then check again if it's created git branch once u see it's created then use git checkout branchName 
now it will point to the new branch and now u can push the code to the new branch because 
master branch is stable once u confirmed then u can push the master
once everything is done then commit the code then 
git push origin branchname





Creating folder from terminal first going that directory cd ..
Jeys-MBP:/ jey$ mkdir /Users/jey/Documents/gittxt
Then git init 

Then copy from github link.  Example 
git remote add origin https://github.com/JeyhunAli/gittxt.git

then git clone url 
then creating file from terminal touch file1.txt

then if you want to write something into this file 
vim file1.txt 
then press I insert some value or text

then press esc and   :wq  or :wq!  to get out 

then git status 

then git add . 
then git commit -m “your message”

then git branch you will see master branch in green color 

then git branch branch name – creating new branch 
then git branch you will see two branch one master another one given 

then switch the branch --- git checkout branchname

then git branch it will point to created one 
then vim file2.txt   press I enter your text then esc then :wq 
do some changes 
ls enter 

then git add . 
then git status
then git commit -m “your message ”
then git push origin test1

in cmd line if you want to print what is written inside the file 
then cat file1.txt enter


In git  git push -u origin test2 
-u It's means  pls add untracked file also which is not commited 


And about how to to pr process for that pull request for 
First click pull reguest add your comments assign it to specific person 
Then click create pull request once your reguest get approved then merge it 




Now some new topics in git about centralized repository and distributed repository 

Centralized version control system  CVCS
SVN VSS PERFORCE CVS

DVCS distributed version control system 
GIT BITBUCKET BAZAAR

Git fetch and pull 
This concept we use let's say our team lead or senior guy pushed already new code to the master branch after couple day 
Another guy have to get it In his working set 
No need to to everytime git clone after new code available on master branch here we use fetch or pull 

Fetch and pull almost same but there is configuration is different it might be confusing 
So pull directly pulling to working copy are and same time it goes to the local repo 

But with the fetch first it goes to local repo then you have to merge it from local repo to working copy area 
Differences between fetch and pull 
With the fetch we have to use merge cmd in order to have it in local set
But pull bring it directly working set

Git pull origin master  you can pull updated verion of the project
Git remote -v  this cmd will show you exact link if something changed in git repo

Once u made some changes in github 
While pushing new something it wont push 

First u have to add . then commit 

Then  u have to use git pull origin master
 It will open comment section in terminal provide with explanation then exit 
Press esc + : + wq! 
It will escape 
And then push your code
