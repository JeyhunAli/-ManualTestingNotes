AWS notes 
So far we were running our test cases in docker through Selenoid ui 
Now Time to move infrastructure to the AWS 
We need linux machine inside AWS and EC2 service
Before that create account in AWS then add your credit card then start enjoying
The show

MC AZURE 
AWS MORE POPULAR 
Go to AWS console then signing create account 
Root user and then next 
Then EC2 service 
Because i want to get some machine thats why compute service then ec2 
Then instances 
Then launch instances 
Landing on 
AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE AMI 
Under AMI A lot of machines available 
THERE ARE different type of the machines but we are gonna use community AMI
Then 
Community AMIs
 Here we need machines with docker-compose 
So that later on no need to download
Docker and compose file 
Then u will see a lot of machines 
Paid 
And free versions 
We will go with free version
Same page u can find 
Aws market place 
In community ami 
Search 
For docker-compose
And select 
buildkite-stack-2017-01-14T02-53-50Z-us-east-2 - ami-007d5865
Buildkite CloudFormation Stack base image (Amazon Linux, buildkite-agent, docker, docker-compose, docker-gc, jq)
Root device type: ebs Virtualization type: hvm ENA Enabled: Yes

First one usually 

And then based on machine specifications u can choose ram cpi 
Type 
At least 2 cpu and 4 gb ram 
To achieve parallel execution 
With the 1 cpu and less gb ram u cannot achieve parallel executing 
Then click configure instance details 



After this is another concept is configuration of cloud platform 

Number of instances 1     we choose one because here one machine is enough 
Network                   if there no by default VPC service then we have to click on create one 
Subnet                    is reflected to availability zone just choose no preference if its applicable 
Then don't change anything just click on add next storage 
Then choose the storage 8 gb then click if u want u can add tag for automation purposes 
Later on to find east if there are multiple of them 
Next page is more important for security purposes 
Here type has to be SSH 
SOURCE  u can choose custom anywhere or my ip in order to prevent access 
Then adding another rule 
Here custom tcp port range we are providing where our selenium test cases will be run 
Port range based on requirements any port number for example 4444 
Once is done review and launch 
Here it will give two warnings because I configured as open to the world 
Then warning to pay because its not free 
Then click on launch it will give you warning to create new pair 
This because of login from local machine to the claud machine 
Then click on download key pair 
Its gonna give u pem file or cer file 
Then launch instances 
And it says your instances are now launching 
Then click on view instances 
Then click on instance id then u will see after some time couple second u will se your instances are running
